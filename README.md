# Fraud Detection in video when the invoice is not returned to the customer after receiving the cash
All the codes used for getting to the final approach were done on colab
This repository contains three colab notebooks - 
1. Retail_Assignment_Pre_processing.ipynb - this contains the codes that demonstrate all the different techniques I tried out 
2. Retail_Assignment_yolo.ipynb - this contains the codes to train the yolov8 model to recognise the note
3. Retail_Assignment_Implementation.ipynb - this contains the code of the final implementation

Additionally, I have also uploaded main.py which can be used to run the inference on a video and the code saves the video with the inference
